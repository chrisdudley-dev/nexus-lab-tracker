# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public GitHub issue.

## Preferred reporting
- Use GitHub's **"Report a vulnerability"** flow (Security tab) if it is available for this repository.
- If that flow is not available, report privately by email: **security@YOUR-DOMAIN.com** (replace with an address you actively monitor).

## What to include
- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Reproduction steps (exact commands / inputs)
- Any suggested mitigations or patches, if you have them

## Response expectations
- We will acknowledge receipt and triage the report.
- We aim to prioritize issues that could lead to data exposure, unauthorized access, or integrity loss.
- We aim to acknowledge reports within **7 days** and provide a status update within **30 days**.

## Scope
- **In scope:** Vulnerabilities in this repository’s code, CI workflows, and related configuration.
- **Out of scope:** Third-party services, social engineering, and denial-of-service testing.

## Safe harbor
We support good-faith security research. Please avoid privacy violations, destructive testing, and service disruption. If you act in good faith and follow this policy, we will not pursue legal action against you.

## Note
This project is currently early-stage; security posture will improve as deployment guidance and authentication layers mature.
