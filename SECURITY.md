Preferred reporting:
- Use GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" flow (Security tab) if it is available for this repository.

What to include:
- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Reproduction steps (exact commands / inputs)
- Any suggested mitigations or patches, if you have them

Response expectations:
- We will acknowledge receipt and triage the report.
