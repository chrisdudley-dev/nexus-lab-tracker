# Security Policy

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public GitHub issue.

## Preferred reporting

1) Use GitHub's **"Report a vulnerability"** flow (Security tab) if it is available for this repository.
2) If that flow is not available, create a **draft security advisory** (Security tab → Advisories → New draft advisory), and include the details below.
3) If neither option is available, contact the maintainer privately via the email listed on the maintainer’s GitHub profile.

## What to include

- A clear description of the issue and potential impact
- Reproduction steps (exact commands / inputs)
- Any suggested mitigations or patches, if you have them
- Version/commit information (branch, tag, or commit SHA), if known

## Response expectations

- We will acknowledge receipt and triage the report.
- We prioritize issues that could lead to data exposure, unauthorized access, or integrity loss.
- We aim to acknowledge reports within **7 days** and provide a status update within **30 days**.

## Scope

**In scope**
- Vulnerabilities in this repository’s code, CI workflows, and related configuration

**Out of scope**
- Third-party services
- Social engineering
- Denial-of-service testing or disruptive scanning
- Testing against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test

## Safe harbor

We support good-faith security research. Please avoid privacy violations, destructive testing, and service disruption. If you act in good faith and follow this policy, we will not pursue legal action against you.

## Note

This project is currently early-stage; security posture will improve as deployment guidance and authentication layers mature.
